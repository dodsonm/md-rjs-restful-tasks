### Giving React a REST[ful] API

This is just a basic task tracking app set up to experiment with the latest React Hooks and connecting to a RESTful API.

Most of the projects, tutorials, and such I've come across mix XHR code into their Components, but I prefer to keep my backend communication code decoupled from UI as much as possible.

Before I research the subject further, I thought it'd be fun to come up with a solution myself first--hence, this project :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
